## About Michelle Laswell 
My name is Michelle Laswell.  I am ***really, really*** excited about this class and everything we are about to learn! I have really been wanting to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have been teaching myself HTML using W3School and Code Academy. I am familiar with CSS but haven gotten stuck on positioning elements on a page. I was using 'float' to position, but have started learning about explict grids and implicit grids. I have created a few web pages on a learn-as-I-go basis.  

The things that I **LOVE** to do are:  
1. Spending time with my grandchildren
2. Playing trivia at The Twisted Cork on Tuesday nights
3. Going to the Library
4. Reading books
5. Listening to local live music
6. Ballroom dancing  

I live in Jessamine County.  We have the greatest library.  To see all that the Jessamine County Public Libary has to offer, here is a link to their website: [Jessamine County Public Library](https://jesspublib.org/)

As I said, I am looking forward to all that we are about to learn in these classes.
